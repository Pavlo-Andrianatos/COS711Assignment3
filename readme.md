This program is a machine learning program that utilizes Pytorch to build a R-CNN. The R-CNN 
uses a pre-trained MobileNetV3-Large model from Pytorch to classify objects.

The data set used for this program can be found here: https://zindi.africa/competitions/makerere-passion-fruit-disease-detection-challenge

This program was developed in Pycharm 2021.2 using Python 3.9.

I have included a conda environment yaml file, so you can recreate the conda environment locally.
